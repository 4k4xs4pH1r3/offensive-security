Use It
To access TheHive, point your browser to the following URL:

http://IP_OF_VM:9000

To access Cortex, point your browser to the following URL:

http://IP_OF_VM:(9001)

Configure TheHive
TheHive is already configured and comes with a default superAdmin account:

admin/thehive1234 for TheHive 3.x versions
admin/secret or admin@thehive.local/secret for thehive 4.x versions
Note : after the first login into TheHive, if the Cortex health check fails (look at the Cortex icon at the bottom right side of the UI), it should success after fully reloading the web page.

Configure Cortex
Cortex is already configured with a superAdmin account admin/thehive1234. An organization training is also pre-installed with an account thehive/thehive1234. This account has read/analyze/orgAdmin privileges and TheHive is already configured to use the Cortex service with its key API.

Analyzers, Responders and their Report Templates
TheHive and Cortex are configured and integrated. Few analyzers are enabled in the training VM:

Abuse Finder,
CyberCrime-Tracker,
DShield_lookup,
File_Info, EMLParser,
Fortiguard_URLCategory,
MaxMind GeoIP,
UnshortenLink,
TalosReputation,
_URLHaus,
Urlscan_io_Search .
Report templates are preinstalled in all virtual machines.

Plug it with MISP
The test VM does not contain a MISP instance and none is configured in TheHive’s configuration file. To play with MISP, you may want to use the VM our good friends at CIRCL provide. Once you’ve downloaded it or if you have an existing instance, edit /etc/thehive/application.conf and follow the configuration guide.

Restart or Go Mad
After each modification of /etc/thehive/application.conf do not forget to restart the service:

$ sudo service thehive restart

After each modification of /etc/cortex/application.conf do not forget to restart the service:

$ sudo service cortex restart

Troubles?
TheHive service logs are located in /var/log/thehive/application.log.

Cortex service logs are located in /var/log/cortex/application.log.
